# DSA Journey

This repository tracks my daily progress in solving Data Structures and Algorithms problems.

## Daily Log

### Day 1
*   **Count Digits**:
    > You are given an integer n. You need to return the number of digits in the number.
    > The number will have no leading zeroes, except when the number is 0 itself.*   
*   **Reverse Digits of A Number**:
    > Given an integer N return the reverse of the given number.*

### Day 2
*   **Check if a number is Palindrome or Not**:
    > A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121, 1331, and 4554 are palindromes because they remain the same when their digits are reversed.
*   **Print all Divisors**:
    > Given an integer `n`, return all of its divisors.
*   **Check Armstrong Number**:
    > Given an integer `n`, check if it is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
*   **Find GCD of two numbers**:
    > Given two non-negative integers `n1` and `n2`, find their greatest common divisor (GCD).*

### Day 3
*   **Print 1 to N using Recursion**:
    > Print numbers from 1 to N using a recursive function.
*   **Print N to 1 using Recursion**:
    > Print numbers from N to 1 using a recursive function.
*   **Sum of first N Natural Numbers**:
    > Given an integer N, find the sum of the first N natural numbers.
*   **Factorial of a Number**:
    > Given an integer N, find its factorial.
*   **Check if a number is Prime**:
    > Given an integer N, determine if it is a prime number.*
